# BallisticChronograph
Data repository for Arduino-based Ballistic Chronograph.  This repository is no longer being updated since release of the MK2.  For the MK2, please see [https://github.com/td0g/ballistic_chronograph_mk2/](https://github.com/td0g/ballistic_chronograph_mk2/)

## Documentation

The Sensor Emitter Schematic is a complete electrical diagram for the ballistic chronograph.

The BOM is only for the electronics.

The drawings include a perfboard layout and a drawing of the sensors and emitters.  Notice the spacing of the sensors and emitters - this particular configuration is the best optimization using only 8 sensors and 8 emitters.

## Firmware

I'm maintaining updated firmware at https://github.com/td0g/ballistic_chronograph_mk2/tree/master/Firmware.  Please check it out for a few flavours of chronograph firmware!
