Input Voltage: 2.0 - 6.0 volts
Input Current: TBD, ~20 - 50 mA
Signal: Vin normal, 0V when light reduction is detected
Pinout: GND   Vin   SIGNAL

Sensitivity adjustment:
Each photodiode's sensitivity can be adjusted individually
Using a multimeter set to millivolts, place the leads on the test pads
Turn the potentiometer to adjust senstivity.  Larger voltage = less sensitive.
